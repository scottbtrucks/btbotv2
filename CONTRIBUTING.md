## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code follows our coding standards
6. Issue that pull request!

## Pull Request Process

1. Update the README.md with details of changes if applicable
2. Update the documentation in the `/docs` directory
3. The PR will be merged once you have the sign-off of at least one maintainer
