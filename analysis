// Systems Thinking: Voiceflow TTS Integration Feasibility Analysis
/*
Voiceflow is primarily known as a conversational AI design and development platform, 
offering voice app development tools. While they do have TTS capabilities, these are 
typically integrated within their platform rather than offered as a standalone API 
service like Play.ht or ElevenLabs.

Key considerations for integration:
1. API Availability: Voiceflow's TTS may not be designed for direct API integration
2. Russian Language Support: Need to verify quality of Russian voices
3. Integration Complexity: May require working within Voiceflow's ecosystem
4. Cost Structure: Would need to evaluate pricing model
